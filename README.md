# Wrist-Wearable-Sensor-to-Predict-Opioid-Induced-Respiratory-Depression
This project aims to develop a wrist-wearable prediction system that uses photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to achieve both real-time and multi-horizon forecasting of blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂) and respiratory rate (RR), enabling early detection of opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD).
